*Maybe mark the hardest word in bold and give it a higher weight?

*Add a proper lemmatizer (Probably not realistic?)

*Add certain tags to definition and remove sentences with certain tags

*Don't add that many cards for the same "hardest" bolded word

*Find a way to reduce the number of sentences (not a problem for Czech-German, but for other languages surely)
->Set the max sentence limit (and fix this, currently broken)

*Filter out names out of the sentence difficulty calculation?

*Give higher weight to the rarest word?

*Add alternative translations (possibly hidden behind details tag) -> If source sentence is duplicate

*At the end create a shared Google Docs document about how to learn Czech efficiently
*To je vsechno -> duplicate with other punctuation exists (unfortunately), but shouldn't
*Remove sentences by non-native speakers
*When finished, promote
